        <p>Hi, I am Manav Mittal. I am from Meerut. 
            I completed my highschool and senior secondary education from St. Thomas' English Medium School (STEMS) and I'm currently a 
            second yearite in BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus, pursuing BE in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE).
             </p>
             <p>
                 My father owns a business in partnership with my uncle and my mother is a middle school science teacher. 
                 My younger brother is currently in sixth standard in STEMS.
             </p>
             <p>
                 I enjoy coding and I have represented my school in two district level competitions having taken the first
                  place in one and second place in the other. Along with four fellow students, I organised the first ever interschool computer
                  fest hosted by our school, STSAP( St. Thomas' Symposium and Programming) Season One - LINKX().
