                    I completed my highschool and senior secondary education from St. Thomas' English Medium School.
                    For senior secondary education I studied Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics along with Computer 
                    Science and English.

                        I have always had an interest in coding, and through these years I have gained intermediate knowledge 
                        of Java, cleared basic levels of C and Python. I also represented my school in two interschool competitions 
                        held in my city, Meerut, namely:
